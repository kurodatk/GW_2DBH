# GW_2DBH

Gravitational waveforms from massive stellar collapse to a BH in 2D axisymmetry.
All models are reported in https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/533/1/L107/7718093, though without GWs.
GWs only for a non-rotating model (R0B00 in the above literature) are discussed in https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/526/1/152/7264868.

From left, each column denotes:
time relative to the first bounce (i.e. usual post bounce time) [ms],
time relative to the BH formation [ms],
Dh+ [cm], where D and h+ are the source distance and the only non-vanishing GW strain observed along equator, respectively.

Note that model R1B12 does not provide GWs from slightly before the BH formation, because of the lack of original simulation datas.
